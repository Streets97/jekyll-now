title: Progress on Week 3 
---

The first thing I did this week was working on part of the draft for the user guide, although i'm not entirely sure whether it
will be used in it's current state. I spent 1 hour on this.

The next thing that I worked on was the target user section of the UI spec. I spent 1 hour working on this.

The final thing I did this week was going through the proposed test specification and attempting to find any requirements that
could be added to the test specification. I spent 2 hours on this.
