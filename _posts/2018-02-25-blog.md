title: Progress on Week 4 
---

This week my main task was going through the Java look and feel guideline document and attempting to come up with a summary of the relevant information within that document to relay to the rest of the group to be of use while buildingJoggleCube. I managed to come up with a summary of what I feel were the important parts, although I found that some of the document could not be easily or effectively summarised, so a couple of the pages are referred to as important. I spent 3 hours doing this, and while I believe I did it effectively, there may have been bits that I missed. This was due to me ensuring that I did not spend too long doing this as our group project tutor said that it shouldn't take too long.
