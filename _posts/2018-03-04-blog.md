title: Progress on Week 5 
---

This week I worked on the corrections to the documents submitted and reviewed by Chris Price. This involved adding a couple of sentences to
the typical users of JoggleCube as well as expanding and rewriting parts of the use case section so that it was comprised of a paragraph or so per
user case. I also changed and added some user errors, based on the feedback. This took me 2 hours.
