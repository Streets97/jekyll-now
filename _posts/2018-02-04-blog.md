title: Progress on Week 1 - Basic Architecture
---

To start with looking at the architecture of the software, I first took the requirement specification and worked out,
on the most basic level, what the program needed to do. This was so I could start looking at what different classes I
would need as well as how I think would be best to split up the different functions in the way of which class they belong
in.

This was where I ran into some difficulties, as I struggled to work out what classes I needed, which the knowledge of is integral to the
basic architecture of the software.

I spent 4 hours working on this and the end result was working out some the potential functions for the software. I was not able to come up with a UML Diagram for the design, However I spend some time working with Tom to give some input to the UML Diagram that he had come up with.
