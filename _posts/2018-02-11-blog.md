title: Progress on Week 2 
---

This week I was still partially assigned the architecture. I was not able to make much headway on this at all. I spent 1 hour on this.

I went to a group meeting later in the week, discussing progress as well as who would be take the the roles of project leader and
quality assurance leader.
